    <p class="about-us__para--first">Kings Auto Services is an approved member of the Retail Motor Industry Federation (R.M.I.), the Federation of Small Businesses, and the Trust My Garage scheme, so you can be assured of high quality service.</p>
    <p>Our garage is equipped with class 4 MOT facilities, but we can also cater to all your other vehicle needs, including services and repairs, engine diagnostics and electrical work. Our rates are very competitive, offering the services of a main dealer at a much lower cost. All jobs are discussed with the customer before starting work, and we will only carry out repairs that are genuinely needed.</p>
    <p>We understand the inconvenience of taking your car to the garage and being without a vehicle, so we currently offer three courtesy cars, and a local collection service. If required, we can collect your car from work or home and leave a courtesy vehicle for you.</p>
